				<h1>Technical debt or mess ?</h1>
				<!--<p>The other day, I had to work on a project on which a developer told me than this project had a technical debt. When I opened it, I saw no technical debt, but a mess, just a mess. So let's be clear : a technical debt IS NOT a mess. A technical debt is a choice, a considered, reasoned decision, who allows you to do what you have to do quickly, but also constraints you to be the most professional you can be if you want to have a chance to solve this debt one day, and you will have too. Your code has to be clean, commented, well-written. You have to test it, and you have to refactor it the most you can. The mess ? It's just a mess. Some low-quality and disorganized code, based on incompetence, or laziness and unprofessionalism.</p>
				<p>A technical debt has always to be a business-driven decision who matches with a long-term strategy, and never be a developer's choice. The business is the only department who can judge that a version of a product has to be released early, involved a delay on the next version cause of the debt the technical team will have to solve before to develop some others functionalities. The most important thing with a technical debt is that at the end, the business has to win. This is a business call, a well-considered decision by people who see the big picture, whereas a mess is just a mess, and always a loss. A mess is always a loss. This is hard to read, hard to understand, hard to clean and has absolutely no chance of paying in the future.</p>

				<p>The other day, I had to work on a project, apparently having a technical debt, as said a developer who worked on it. When I opened it, I didn't see any technical debt, but rather a mess, only a mess. So let's be clear: a technical debt IS NOT a mess. A technical debt is a choice, a considered, reasoned decision, which allows you to do what you have to do quickly, but also constrains you to be as professional as you can be if you want to have a chance to solve this debt one day, and you will have to. Your code must be clean, commented, well-written. You have to test it, and you have to refactor it as much as you can. The mess? It's just a mess. Some low-quality and disorganized code, based on incompetence, or laziness and unprofessionalism.</p>
				<p>A technical debt must be a business-driven decision in line with a long-term strategy, it should never be a developer's choice. The business is the only department which can judge that a version of a product has to be released early, involving a delay on the next version as the technical team will have to solve the debt before to develop others functionalities. The most important thing with a technical debt is that at the end, the business has to win. This is a business call, a well-considered decision by people who see the big picture, whereas a mess is nothing more than a mess, and always ends up to be a loss. A mess is always a loss. It is hard to read, hard to understand, hard to clean and has absolutely no chance of benefit in the future.</p>
