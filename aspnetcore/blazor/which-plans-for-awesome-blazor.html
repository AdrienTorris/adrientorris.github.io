				<h1>Which plans for Awesome Blazor?</h1>
				<p>For 2 years now I have been managing a GitHub repository, Awesome Blazor, which is a collection of great resources about Blazor, an open-source product from Microsoft which enables us to run .NET in the Browser (yes it's as awesome as it sounds, if you discover this term right now, you really have to check this out after reading this post).</p>
				<p>Like Blazor, the repository which was just a personal MarkDown file 2 years ago has grown a lot, as well as its responsibility as the community who uses and expects great resources and information from Awesome Blazor gets bigger every day. Moreover, Awesome Blazor is linked by Microsoft from the official Blazor website so this repository has definitelyto reached a certain level of quality.</p>
				<p>Awesome Blazor has reached a point which led me to wonder how to do this well, in the long-term. I thought about this a lot in the last few weeks and I'm considering adding new collaborators to the repository, for two main reasons.</p>
				<p>First, I really like the spirit of Blazor, and the spirit of all the .NET Core products by the way, which is open-source and really community-welcoming. That is why I find a little disturbing to be the only owner of this repository and I feel that it will more embrace the spirit of .NET Core once it will have several owners.</p>
				<p>The second reason is that I am not always available, and Awesome Blazor deserves to have some backups. For example, I left in vacations the two last weeks of May this year, in a place without Internet connection (which was a little bit the purpose to be honest), and when I came back there were 10 Pull Requests and several issues without answer since 10 days. I think that this is disrespectful for the people who wanted to help us building a better repository and the people who maintain some libraries or samples, besides it's doesn't give a good image of Blazor, maybe even of Microsoft, and they don't deserve it. I do not plan to get some rest or to be less active on this project, at the contrary, so I feel that it's time to open this repo to include completely the community in the process.</p>
				<p>I still need to address some questions like "How many collaborators?", "Which kinds of profile are adapted to become collaborators? "Which responsibilities for these new collaborators?", "Where is my place in all of this?" and "Does it make sense to have this repository attached to my GitHub profile? Or does it make more sense to move this repository to a dedicated organization?", anyway the process is started.</p>
				<p>I created an issue and posted a tweet two days ago and I was not expected so much interest, several people would like to get involved, which is something I did not anticipate. These questions are now more urgent than ever and I will answer them quickly, so here is the thing to keep in mind: The process of opening Awesome Blazor to the community has started! and I hope that it will help to build a better repository, to help Blazor growing as best as we can, and to take care about its really awesome community.</p>
				<p>Cheers.</p>
